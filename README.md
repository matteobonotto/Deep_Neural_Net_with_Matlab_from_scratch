# Deep Neural Network with Matlab from scratch for regression tasks.

A simple implementation of deep neural network (a multi-layers perceptron) in Matlab for regression problems. The aim of this code is to give some insights on what is a deep neural network, how forward/backward propagation work and how can be implemented in few lines of codes, andn most of all, to provide a viable example to everyone wishing to implement a deep neural network from scratch. 

These routines are inspired by the code which can be found on the Github repo https://github.com/vtshitoyan/simpleNN by Vahe Tshitoyan. Huge thanks!
